     Fill in the package name and signature hash(SHA-1 fingerprint)
     of the Application using the below tags. And repeat the whole Application tag

     package name and signature hash are present, it will not consider
     the application information where only one is present.
     NOTE: While adding more applications, please use the same tag names
     There should be only one Entries Tag. There can be many Application tags
     And the Application Tags should contain PackageName and SignatureHash tags ONLY
     if any unexpected tag is added, the parsing will fail and will not populate the list
