        <h1>OMA DRM v1 Design document</h1>

        <h2>OMA DRM Plugin For Android M (OmaDrmEngine)</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3><hr>

        <p>
        This documents covers the high level design for OMA DRM 1.0
        implementation for Android M. AOSP provides DRM Framework
        and Forward Lock plug-in to support basic DRM usage, where,
        it is valid only for Forward Lock audio and video. This
        Forward Lock plugin supports minimal features for OMA DRM v1
        where Forward Lock Image, Combine Delivery and Separate
        Delivery  of any media(Image, Audio, Video) were not supported.
        In order to support complete OMA DRM v1 in the Android platform M,
        we have designed this 'OmaDrmEngine'  plugin. The architecture,
        technical support information and Control Flows of  same  is
        described in the document. If any one asking, What is OMA DRM?
        The answer is very simple. Its is 'Digital Right Management'
        environment where device can efficiently manage/play
        Rights-protected media contents. To know more about DRM,
        please do not forget to read OMA DRM v1 specification,
        where you can find much more about DRM.

        <h4>Here, are some basic FAQ, user can get basic Idea of OMA DRM feature :</h4>
        <h4>What is DRM content?</h4>
        <p>
            Digital rights management (DRM) is an approach to prevent
            unauthorized redistribution.
            Drm contents are license based media contents
            and unauthorized use of same is prohibited.

        </p>

        <h4>How many types of DRM media files?</h4>
        <p>
            All Drm media files can be categorized in one of the following -</p>

            <p><b>Forward Lock (FL)- </b>Forward Lock prevents illegal
            copying of files.</p>

            <p><b>Combined Delivery (CD) - </b>Extension of forward lock,
            The user can use the content as defined in the rights object.
            The rights object defines the number of times and length of
            time that the content can be used.</p>

            <p><b>Seperate Delivery (SD) - </b> In the Separate Delivery mode,
             the content and rights are packaged and delivered separately.
            The Rights Object (RO) and the Content Encryption Key (CEK) are
            packaged and transferred in a safe way such as unconfirmed
            Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) push or HTTPS.
            User is allowed to forward the content message but not the
            rights message.</p>
        </p>

        <h4>Where/how to download DRM media?</h4>
        <p>
            User can downaload DRM media contents from one of the many
            DRM content providers.<br>
            e.g - Service providers such as AT&T, Telcel, Verizon, Claro ...

        </p>

        <h4>What is DRM rights/license?</h4>
        <p>Rights/License is the mean of providing autorization to
        access rights protected contents.</p>

        <h4>What are the license constraints?</h4>
        <p>
            The rights object defines the number of times and length of
            time that the content can be used.<br>
            e.g - Count based (x number of times)<br>
            Date and time based (From start to end date)<br>
            Interval based (For x period)
        </p>

        <h4>Wow many formats of license files?</h4>
        <p>
            Two formats of license files are used for distribution, XML and WB-XML.
        </p>

        <h4>How to buy license form DRM content vendor?</h4>
        <p>User can buy lincense from content provider.</p>

        <h4>What all media files are supported for DRM?</h4>
        <p>
            Image/Mimetype - JPG, BMP, PNG, GIF, WBMP ...<br>
            Audio/Mimetype - AMR, AAC, MIDI, IMY, WAV, M4A, MP3, 3GA, OGG ...<br>
            Video/Mimetype - MP4, 3GP ...
        </p>

        <h4>What are the use of DRM file?</h4>
        <p>To prevent unauthorized redistribution. User can use(Play/Display,
        Set as ringtone, Set as wallpaper) the content as per available license.</p>

        <h4>Can I share download DRM file?</h4>
        <p>Unauthorized redistribution is prohibited.</p>

        <h4>Can any one Share DRM rights?</h4>
        <p>No.</p>

        <h4>Can I share DRM file in Social Network?</h4>
        <p>No.</p>

        <h4>Is there any way or hack to get DRM file for the Device?</h4>
        <p>There is no way to get DRM content from device is useful form.
        DRM files are stored in shared location(such as SD card) in encrypted form.</p>

        <h4>Is there any way or hack to make DRM file unlimited use?</h4>
        <p>No, DRM license are private to device installed and there is no way to temper license.</p>

        <h4>Is there any Free DRM contents available online for Testing purpose?</h4>
        <p>
            Free DRM content are available for testing purpose.<br>
            Some of the sites providing free DRM contents are -<br>

        <h3>DRM architecture</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The Android platform provides an extensible DRM framework that
            lets applications manage rights-protected content according to
            the license constraints that are associated with the content.
            The DRM framework supports many DRM schemes; which DRM schemes
            a device supports is up to the device manufacturer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Android DRM framework is implemented in two architectural
            layers (see figure below):
        </p>
        <li>
            <ul>
               A DRM framework API, which is exposed to applications through
               the Android application framework and runs through the Android
               VM for standard applications.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                A native code DRM manager, which implements the DRM framework
                and exposes an interface for DRM plug-ins (agents) to handle
                rights management and decryption for various DRM schemes.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <p>
            For application developers, the DRM framework offers an abstract,
            unified API that simplifies the management of rights-protected content.
            The API hides the complexity of DRM operations and allows a consistent
            operation mode for both rights-protected and unprotected content across
            a variety of DRM schemes. For device manufacturers, content owners,
            and Internet digital media providers the DRM framework`s plugin
            architecture provides a means of adding support for a specific
            DRM scheme to the Android system.

        <h3>OmaDrmEngine</h3>
        <p>
            OmaDrmEngine is complete solution of OMA DRM v1, it comprises
            three main components, first one a native library `libomadrmengine.so`
            which work as a DRM service plugin, second one a Android application
            `OmaDrmEngine` for Rights management,  Rights-protected Image viewer
            and Utility Framework for DRM and third one a  OMA DRM Demo application.
            The `libomadrmengine.so` is the name of our DRM plugin which is
            resides in /system/vendor/lib/drm/. As shown in the figure below,
            the DRM framework uses a plug-in architecture to support various DRM schemes.
            The DRM manager service runs in an independent process to ensure isolated
            execution of DRM plug-ins. Each API call from DrmManagerClient to
            DrmManagerService goes across process boundaries by using the binder
            IPC mechanism. The DrmManagerClient provides a Java programming language
            implementation as a common interface to runtime applications; it also
            provides a DrmManagerClient-native implementation as the interface to
            native modules. The caller of DRM framework accesses only the
            DrmManagerClient and does not have to be aware of each DRM scheme.
            Plug-ins are loaded from `/system/vendor/lib/drm/` and `/system/lib/drm/`
            automatically when DrmManagerService is started.

        </p>
        <h4>Components of OmaDrmEngine :</h4>
        <img src="img/oma_drm_components.png">
        <p>
            <b>`libomadrmengine.so` :</b>
            <p>
                This is a native(C, C++) library, responsible for core DRM
                functionality. It contains DRM Encryption, Decryption and
                Rights management of the Rights protected contents. What
                are the internal mechanism implemented here is described
                below. This library must include in the production.
            </p>
            <b>`OmaDrmEngine Application` :</b>
            <p>
                This app is the supporting component of the OMA DRM plugin
                `libomadrmengine.so`, it play most important role in the
                OMA DRM complete solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                DRM Image Viewer and Rights Management is the most important
                feature of this application. All types of Drm image can be
                display through application. Download provider or
                File Manager types of application fire a Intent.ACTION_VIEW
                intent to display Drm image files. There is no other way
                to display DRM Image file in the device.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rights Management module of the application is responsible
                for parsing WBXML, Receiving WAP PUSH messages for rights
                and intimating  native drm pluging for rights installation.
                Once rights expired for DRM file this module has also
                responsibility to show proper error prompt to the user
                where user can renew license of the media file. Another
                feature of the module is to display `Details` of the DRM
                file where clearly mentioned the original media type and
                remaining licens information of the media content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Utility frameworks(Java) of the app is the bridge between
                Rights Management, Image Viewer and `libomadrmengine.so`
                via native Utility Framework.
            </p>
            <b>`Utility Framework – native` :</b>
            <p>
                This is a shared library placed under
                `/system/lib/libomadrmengineutil_jni.so`, it is used to get
                DRM image data for DRM server plugin and other communication
                like License Consume intimation, License expired notification
                between the App and DRM plugin.
            </p>
            <b>`OMA DRM Demo application` :</b>
            <p>This app will demonstrate the DRM contents behavior in the device.
            The Demo application should not be participate on the production
            releases, OEM has responsibility to remove this demo application
            from the build.</p>
