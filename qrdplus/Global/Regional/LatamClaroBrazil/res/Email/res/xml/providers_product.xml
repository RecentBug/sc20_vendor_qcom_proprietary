    Email providers that are considered "universal" and are appropriate for *all* android
    platform devices should be defined in providers.xml.

    Entries that are device, product or carrier-specific should be added as overlays
    in the appropriate providers_product.xml file.

    Because overlays must correspond to an existing platform resource, this empty placeholder
    is included in the platform build.
